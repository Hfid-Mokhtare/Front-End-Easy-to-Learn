/*
Vendors Prefixes

-> vendors like : 
- Chorome
- Safari
- Firefox
- IE, Edge
- Opera

-> we add Prefixes when: 
[1] New css Feature Appeared
[2] Browsers Tests The Feature In Version X
[3] Browsers Add Prefix To Give Developers The Ability To Use It
[4]  The feature is fully supported in version Y, NO need for prefix

*/

/* 
this is an example of border-radius : 
=> to work withe a new featur you have to add prefixes: 

-webkit- => Chrome, Safari, New Opera Version
-moz- => Firefox
-ms- => Ie, Edge
-o- => Old Version of Opera

=> if you know that all browsers suporte this fiture you don't have to 
add these prefixes

=> to know that ther is some websits like : "Can i use"

*/

.class{
-webkit-border-radius: 10px;
-moz-border-radius: 10px;
-o-border-radius: 10px;
-ms-border-radius: 10px;
border-radius: 10px;

}


/*

=> but
- the most of users now have modern browsers
- vs code Addon to add the prefixes automaticly
- Task Runner < we will learn it later >
